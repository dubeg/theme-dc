Must
````
	[ ] Hide tab's close button completely with a setting (close only with ctrl+w).
	[ ] Smaller search panel (for small screens i.e. laptops).
	[ ] Update Readme with fewer images..
		[ ] One assets sheet/image 
		[ ] One main window (default, without settings)

Ideas
`````
	[ ] Add VisualStudioDark color scheme (?)
	[ ] Assets @ 2x
	[ ] An icon different for each filetype: .cpp, .c, .h

	[ ] Simplify alternate widget styles (files).
		Notes:
			To change widget style/colors, a user needs to add in the User (or is it Packages) directory, a file named 'Widget - DC_<#>.sublime-settings' containing..
			```
			{
				"color_scheme": "Packages/Theme - DC/assets/Widget_<name>.stTheme",
			}
			```

			As well as adding 'dc_use_widget_style<#>' or 'dc_use_widget_<name>' in their user settings alias Preferences so that
			the settings in 'DC_<#>.sublime-theme' are set to match the colors in 'Widget_<name>.stTheme'.
