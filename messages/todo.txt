Note: 
.h  (possible?)
.c  (possible?)

I tried playing with the syntax package, 
but its still very obscure. It looks like
subl assigns only one icon for each scopename, 
and not for every file extension.

The C++ tmLanguage file includes the .c and .h
extensions, so cpp, c and h files all share the same scopename,
and therefore the same icon, and theres nothing we can do about it. 
I hope jps will change that behavior sometime in the future.
