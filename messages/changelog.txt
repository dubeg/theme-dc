v1.2.4 (WIP)
-----------------------------------------------

Note: '.no-sublime-package' didnt fix invisible icon.
      It seems like a bug, sometimes icons will be visible at startup,
      sometimes they won't. A mouse click on any tree row will fix it.

      Also, not all filetypes are working. '.c' and '.h', for ex, 
      don't have a specific icon. Others are simply not recognized.


General
---
    * Replaced icons for filetypes
        - C#
        - C++
        - text 
    * Deleted .no-sublime-package because it doesnt seem to fix the problem.
    * Renamed setting "mouse_wheel_switches_tabs" to "dc_mouse_wheel_switches_tabs"
    * Renamed setting "bold_folder_labels" to "dc_bold_folder_labels"

    * Compatible with Theme - Default settings
        * show_tab_close_buttons
        * mouse_wheel_switches_tabs
        * bold_folder_labels
        NOTE: 
            highlight_modified_tabs     not included
            enable_tab_scrolling        not included/unnecessary
            overlay_scroll_bars         not included/doesnt work for some reason
